# DevOps Demo Projects

Welcome to the DevOps Demo Projects repository, a hands-on showcase of end-to-end DevOps practices, 
from containerization and infrastructure-as-code to Kubernetes orchestration and cloud deployment.
This repository serves as a portfolio of practical, real-world projects demonstrating modern DevOps workflows,
tooling, and best practices.


---

# üöÄ Purpose

The goal of this repository is to **demonstrate practical DevOps skills in action**, including:

- Building and deploying containerized applications with **Docker**
- Provisioning cloud infrastructure with **Infrastructure-as-Code (Terraform)**
- Deploying and managing applications on **Kubernetes** clusters
- Observability with monitoring stacks **(Prometheus + Grafana)**
- Packaging and templating deployments with **Helm** 
- Leveraging **AWS services** for both virtual machines (EC2) and managed Kubernetes (EKS)
- Implementing **GitOps workflows** with ArgoCD for automated, declarative application deployment and continuous delivery

These projects are fully reproducible, making them ideal for experimentation, learning, and demonstrating practical DevOps capabilities.

# üìÇ Projects Overview
### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Container Deployment Demo

A hands-on project showcasing **end-to-end deployment of a Dockerized Flask application on AWS**.

Highlights:

- Docker containerization of a Python Flask app
- AWS infrastructure provisioning with Terraform
- Integration of Prometheus + Grafana for monitoring and observability

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Kubernetes Orchestration Demo

A practical demonstration of **deploying and managing applications on Kubernetes**, including cloud deployment on Amazon EKS.

Highlights:

- Kubernetes manifests for deploying a Flask app both locally and on EKS
- Helm chart packaging for reusable, configurable deployments
- EKS cluster setup with AWS Load Balancer (ALB) and Ingress configuration

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ GitOps Setup with ArgoCD

A demo project illustrating the setup of a full **CI/CD pipeline** using from GitHub Actions.

Highlights:

- AWS infrastructure provisioning using Terraform, including bootstrap deployment of ArgoCD.  
- Deployment of the Flask application via ArgoCD applications using Terraform
- CI/CD integration with GitHub Actions to automatically build images and sync changes to the cluster
